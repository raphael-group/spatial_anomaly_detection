# Results
This directory contains all of the results illustrated in the paper

This directory is broken up further into several more subdirectories
`/GSEA_outputs` contains the results of running the gene set enrichment analysis using webGestalt (https://2024.webgestalt.org/).

Alternatively, you can look at the GSEA outputs using the following links:

 MELD's results are absent as GSEA did not return any significant (FDR < 0.05) results. 

`/simulation_anomaly_scores` contains the anomaly scores outputted by Sardine and other methods on the simulation data.
